## Core Philosophy & Design

### Machine-First Design
- Memento is primarily designed for machine readability and ML attention patterns
- Structure optimised for AI effectiveness, not human browsing
- Semantic clustering and cognitive load respect built into architecture

### Token Investment Philosophy  
- Memento is NOT for token misers
- Quality context costs tokens - typically 40-60% of session budget
- Investment in documentation, context setting, knowledge structuring is valuable
- Better to spend tokens on clarity than save tokens and lose context

### Attention Pyramid/Iceberg Architecture
- **Working Context** (TOP): Must be TINY (≤50 lines total across all files)
- **Active Knowledge**: Can be bigger, frequently referenced material  
- **Institutional Memory**: Larger, searchable archive of proven patterns
- **Evidence Archive** (BOTTOM): Can grow quite big with project history

**Mental Model**: Like an iceberg - you live at the tip (working context) and periodically descend to lower levels for more context, wisdom, or information. Not numbered/linear but depth-based access patterns.

**Critical Rule**: Top 2 tiers MUST be kept svelte for attention efficiency

## Tier Sizing Guidelines

### Working Context (Session-Only)
- Absolute maximum 50 lines across ALL files
- Current task focus only
- Immediate next actions
- Session status
- Complete refresh each session

### Active Knowledge (Multi-Session)
- Frequently referenced material
- Architectural principles
- Feature backlog
- Cross-session reference material
- Update as priorities change

### Institutional Memory (Long-Term)
- Searchable archive of proven patterns
- Development patterns and anti-patterns
- Operating procedures
- Strategic knowledge
- Knowledge graduation from sessions

### Evidence Archive (Historical)
- Can grow large with project
- Detailed artifacts and implementation evidence
- Investigation plans and test results
- Historical analysis and superseded documentation
- Complete session artifacts

## Pattern Notes

### The 5 Failed Paradigms (Evolution Story)
- Epoch 0: Undefined Problem (contextual decay)
- Epoch 1: Documentation-as-Memory (library problem)
- Epoch 2: Quantified Compliance (compliance theatre)  
- Epoch 3: Programmatic Enforcement (fighting the protagonist)
- Epoch 4: Memento Framework (accept amnesiac genius nature)

### Why Memento Works
- Accepts AI limitations rather than fighting them
- Human as "Director" with cognitive scaffolding
- Evidence-first methodology
- Validation gates prevent self-deception
- British English standard throughout

## Detective Theme Elements
- Framework as detective's toolkit for AI orchestration
- Casefiles for real-world examples
- Investigation metaphors throughout
- Evidence-based decision making
- "Field Manual" rather than "User Guide"
