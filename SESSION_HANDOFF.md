# SESSION HANDOFF - Memento Extraction Session 2025-08-08

## Session Achievements

### Completed Extraction
✅ **CORE_DIRECTIVES** - 12 immutable rules from Sky-KA, sanitised and refined
✅ **Memory Prosthesis** - Complete 4-tier iceberg architecture
✅ **Protocols & Playbooks** - Core operational procedures extracted
✅ **Field Guide Notes** - Critical insights documented

### Key Refinements Made
- Removed redundant knowledge capture rule (handled by pre-compact)
- Removed compliance theatre prevention rule (meta-theatrical)
- Enhanced pre-compact protocol with archive review requirement
- Fixed file extension consistency (.MD → .md)
- Added protocols README explaining hierarchy
- Added DOCUMENTATION_PLAYBOOK (vital for learning mechanism)

## Critical Learnings This Session

### 1. Memento Evolution Story
- **TRV2** (Original) → **KA** (Automation) → **Sky-KA** (Excellence)
- 5 Failed paradigms before Memento succeeded
- Only Memento survived because it accepted AI limitations

### 2. Design Philosophy Insights
- **Machine-first design** for AI effectiveness, not human browsing
- **Token investment philosophy** - 40-60% on context quality
- **Iceberg/pyramid mental model** - not numbered tiers but depth-based access
- **Temporal differentiation** - CURRENT_FOCUS "what now" vs STATUS "what accomplished"

### 3. Reality vs Templates
- Generic templates intentionally sparse
- Real implementations are rich (Sky-KA: 159-828 lines per file)
- Memento requires substantial content investment
- Framework evolves with project (not static)

### 4. Documentation as Metabolism
- DOCUMENTATION_PLAYBOOK is vital for self-healing
- It's how experiences become knowledge
- Without it, Memento is static; with it, living system

### 5. Housekeeping Requirements
- Periodic maintenance essential (pruning, graduating, deduplicating)
- Keep top tiers svelte for attention efficiency
- Quarantine failed methods to evidence archive
- Reality updates as project evolves

### Git Status
- 16 commits made
- Clean working directory
- Ready for next phase

## Next Priorities (Post-Compact)

### Immediate Next Actions
1. Create compelling README with detective theme
2. Build CASEFILES directory structure
3. Start FIELD_MANUAL from notes
4. Consider reference implementation from Sky-KA

### Pending Tasks
- Build CASEFILES with sanitised real examples
- Create proper FIELD_MANUAL user guide
- Add glossary for domain experts
- Create diagrams for 4-tier structure
- Write evolution story (5 paradigms)

### Decisions Needed
- GitHub templates/CI or keep minimal?
- How much evolution history in main docs?
- Include diagrams initially or text-only?
- Reference implementation alongside or separate?

## Key Context for Continuation

### Sources Still Available
- Sky-KA: `/Users/johnblanch/sky-ka/sky-memento/` (most evolved)
- TRV2: `/Users/johnblanch/team_roadmaps_v2/memento/` (original)
- KA: `/Users/johnblanch/knowledge_assistant/ka-memento/` (automation focus)

### Logo Asset
- Retro-futuristic noir detective image provided
- Located in current directory (not yet moved to assets/)

### Theme & Positioning
- Detective's toolkit for AI orchestration
- Field guide for the perplexed
- Not productivity hack but systematic approach
- British English throughout

## Patterns Worth Preserving

### Extraction Methodology
1. Deep analysis of all three implementations first
2. Identify real usage patterns vs theoretical
3. Extract from most evolved (Sky-KA) 
4. Sanitise systematically (project names → generic)
5. Preserve what works, remove what's theatrical

### Sanitisation Patterns Applied
- "John" → "[User]" or "[Domain Expert]"
- Project names → "[Your Project]"
- Specific paths → generic examples
- Personal context → universal patterns
- Keep British English standard

### Framework Design Decisions
- Iceberg model not numbered hierarchy
- Templates sparse, reference implementation shows depth
- Documentation as learning mechanism
- Housekeeping as essential maintenance
- Memento integrates with project, not separate

## Session Metrics
- Started with deep analysis of 3 implementations
- Extracted core framework components
- Created 10+ template files
- 16 git commits with clean history
- ~90% context used effectively

## Handoff Ready
This session successfully extracted and sanitised the core Memento framework from three production implementations. The foundation is solid and ready for README, CASEFILES, and FIELD_MANUAL creation in next session.
