# Protocols

**Purpose:** Operational procedures and behavioural guidelines for AI-assisted development

**Mental Model:** Your operating manual - CORE_DIRECTIVES are the constitution, playbooks are the procedures

---

## Structure

### CORE_DIRECTIVES.MD
**The Immutable Foundation**
- 11 fundamental rules that never change
- Always active, always followed
- Override everything except user authority
- Form the base operational context

### playbooks/
**Situational Procedures**
- Structured approaches for specific scenarios
- Selected based on current work type
- Referenced in CURRENT_FOCUS.md as "Active Playbook"
- Proven patterns for common development situations

---

## Hierarchy

1. **User Authority** - Sovereign over all
2. **CORE_DIRECTIVES** - Immutable foundation
3. **Active Playbook** - Current procedural guidance
4. **Memory Prosthesis** - Knowledge and context

When CURRENT_FOCUS.md specifies an Active Playbook, that playbook's procedures guide the current work whilst CORE_DIRECTIVES remain constantly enforced.

## Usage Pattern

**Session Start:**
1. AI reads CORE_DIRECTIVES (always)
2. AI reads CURRENT_FOCUS.md (identifies Active Playbook)
3. AI follows specified playbook procedures
4. All work remains bound by CORE_DIRECTIVES

**Pre-Compact Protocol (15-5% context remaining):**
1. User initiates pre-compact knowledge consolidation
2. AI follows Rule 10 protocol: session learning review, archive review, selective graduation
3. User approves all updates before finalising
4. AI prepares clean CURRENT_FOCUS.md for next session

**Session Restart (post-compact):**
1. User triggers restart (`/restart`, `memento restart`, or post-compact reset)
2. AI executes Rule 8 checklist sequence with evidence
3. AI demonstrates actual knowledge of directives and current focus
4. Work resumes with preserved context and clean working memory

**Switching Modes:**
When work type changes, update CURRENT_FOCUS.md with new Active Playbook

**These protocols improve the odds of systematic, safe, and effective AI collaboration whilst maintaining user sovereignty and development discipline.**
