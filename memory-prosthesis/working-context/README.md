# Working Context

**Purpose:** Immediate operational focus for AI collaboration (â‰¤50 lines for optimal ML attention patterns)

**Core File:** `CURRENT_FOCUS.MD` - Primary operational context defining current mission, constraints, and next actions

**Update Frequency:** Every session or major task transition

**Cognitive Load Limit:** Maximum 50 lines total across ALL files in this tier to respect AI attention limitations

---

## Contents

- **CURRENT_FOCUS.MD**: Active task, constraints, success criteria, and immediate next actions
- **STATUS.md**: Current session progress tracking (optional, when needed)

---

## Critical Rules

### Attention Architecture
- This tier is the AI's "current Polaroid" - what it sees first and refers to most
- Must contain ONLY session-critical information
- Everything else belongs in higher tiers

### Size Discipline  
- Absolute maximum 50 lines across all files
- Working context bloat destroys attention efficiency
- When approaching limit, graduate content to active-knowledge tier

### Session Boundaries
- Complete refresh each session
- No accumulation of historical information
- Clean slate for optimal focus

**This tier provides immediate, actionable context for productive AI collaboration whilst respecting ML attention patterns.**
