# Working Context

**Purpose:** Immediate operational focus for AI collaboration (≤50 lines for optimal ML attention patterns)

**Core File:** `CURRENT_FOCUS.md` - Primary operational context defining current mission, constraints, and next actions

**Update Frequency:** Every session or major task transition

**Cognitive Load Limit:** Maximum 50 lines total across ALL files in this tier to respect AI attention limitations

---

## Contents

- **CURRENT_FOCUS.md**: "What Now" - Present-focused operational context (≤35 lines)
- **STATUS.md**: "What Accomplished" - Session retrospective and handoff (≤15 lines)

## Critical Rules

### Attention Architecture
- This tier is the AI's "surface view" - what it sees first and refers to most
- Must contain ONLY session-critical information
- Everything else belongs in higher tiers

### Size Discipline  
- Absolute maximum 50 lines across all files
- Working context bloat destroys attention efficiency
- When approaching limit, graduate content to active-knowledge tier

### Temporal Differentiation
- **CURRENT_FOCUS.md**: Present-focused ("What now?")  
- **STATUS.md**: Past-focused ("What happened?")
- Clear role separation prevents redundancy

### Session Boundaries
- Both files refresh each session
- STATUS documents achievements before refresh
- CURRENT_FOCUS sets direction for new session  
- No historical accumulation across sessions

**This tier provides immediate, actionable context for productive AI collaboration whilst respecting ML attention patterns.**
