## Architecture Patterns

### Mode-Aware Data Architecture {#mode-aware-data-architecture}

**Pattern:** Dynamic data source selection based on user configuration state

**Implementation:**
- Database schema supporting both standard (shared) and custom (user-specific) data modes
- Query layer checking user configuration to determine data source
- Audit trail tracking mode transitions with timestamps
- Single query determining correct data source for performance

**Prevention Value:** Prevents data contamination between shared and personalised content whilst maintaining query performance

**Example Application:** User preference system where teams can use standard categories or create custom ones, with automatic data isolation and easy reset capability.

---

### Component Isolation Architecture {#component-isolation-architecture}

**Pattern:** Design system components with clear boundaries and minimal coupling

**Implementation:**
- Single responsibility per component with explicit interfaces
- Dependency injection for external services and data sources
- Error boundaries preventing cascade failures across component tree
- State management isolated to component scope or explicit sharing

**Prevention Value:** Enables isolated testing, reduces debugging complexity, and prevents failures from propagating across system boundaries

**Example Application:** Frontend components designed with clear data contracts, allowing individual component testing and preventing rendering failures from affecting entire application.

---

### Cache Invalidation Coordination {#cache-invalidation-coordination}

**Pattern:** Coordinated cache management for related data dependencies

**Implementation:**
- Dependency mapping between related data queries
- Mutation hooks invalidating both primary and dependent queries
- Cache key strategies enabling selective invalidation
- Race condition prevention through query coordination

**Prevention Value:** Prevents stale data inconsistencies after state changes whilst maintaining application performance

**Example Application:** User preference changes invalidating both user data and dependent UI state queries, ensuring consistent application state across all components.

**Cross-References:**

- Related: [Data Flow Debugging Methodology](#data-flow-debugging)

---

### Performance Validation Framework {#performance-validation-framework}

**Pattern:** Algorithm complexity validation against real usage patterns rather than theoretical limits

**Implementation:**
- Real data testing using actual user configurations and typical data sizes
- Scale boundary testing at maximum expected usage rather than theoretical limits
- Browser performance profiling measuring actual rendering and calculation times
- User experience requirements driving performance targets

**Prevention Value:** Prevents premature optimisation whilst ensuring adequate performance for real usage scenarios

**Example Application:** Visual layout algorithm validated against realistic data sets rather than optimised for theoretical worst-case scenarios, ensuring good user experience within actual usage constraints.

**Cross-References:**
- See: [Performance Assumption Anti-Pattern](#performance-assumption-anti-pattern)
- Related: [Browser DevTools Investigation Pattern](#browser-devtools-investigation)

---

### Security Hardening Protocol {#security-hardening-protocol}

**Pattern:** Systematic vulnerability assessment and remediation for multi-tenant applications

**Implementation:**
- Vulnerability identification prioritised by impact (data corruption > destruction > exposure)
- One operation at a time implementation with immediate testing
- Interface compatibility maintenance to prevent breaking changes
- Standard ownership verification pattern applied consistently

**Prevention Value:** Prevents data breaches and unauthorised access through systematic ownership verification

**Example Application:** Multi-tenant application securing update/delete operations by adding user ownership verification to prevent cross-tenant data access.

## Anti-Patterns

### Performance Assumption Anti-Pattern {#performance-assumption-anti-pattern}

**Problem:** Making optimisation decisions without measuring actual performance impact

**Symptoms:**
- Complex caching strategies implemented before performance issues identified
- Algorithm complexity reduction sacrificing functionality for unmeasured benefits
- Infrastructure scaling without usage pattern analysis
- Code optimisation consuming development time without measurable user benefit

**Prevention Strategy:**
- Measure actual performance before optimising using realistic data and usage patterns
- Focus on user-perceived performance metrics rather than theoretical improvements
- Profile real usage scenarios rather than worst-case theoretical situations
- Require performance evidence to justify optimisation effort investment

**Prevention Value:** Prevents engineering effort waste and functionality degradation through evidence-based performance decisions

**Cross-References:** 
- See: [Performance Validation Framework](#performance-validation-framework)

---

### Mock Data Persistence Anti-Pattern {#mock-data-persistence}

**Problem:** Test and development data surviving into production or contaminating real user data

**Symptoms:**
- Hardcoded test users appearing in production interfaces
- Development configuration overriding production settings in unexpected ways
- Test data mixed with real user data causing confusion and system unreliability
- Mock API responses cached and served to actual users

**Prevention Strategy:**
- Strict environment isolation preventing test data from reaching production
- Automatic cleanup procedures for temporary and test data
- Runtime configuration validation ensuring production uses production data sources
- Database seeding procedures that are controlled and reversible

**Prevention Value:** Maintains data integrity and professional user experience through systematic development data isolation

**Cross-References:** 
- See: [Database Migration Safety Protocol](#database-migration-safety)

**Symptoms:**
- Multiple configuration files with overlapping and conflicting settings
- Environment-specific configuration scattered across codebase and deployment systems
- Configuration changes requiring code changes instead of deployment-time specification
- Difficulty determining actual configuration values in running systems

**Prevention Strategy:**
- Centralised configuration management with clear precedence rules
- Environment-specific configuration isolated from application code
- Configuration validation at application startup with clear error messages
- Configuration documentation maintained alongside code changes

**Prevention Value:** Reduces deployment complexity and configuration-related production issues through systematic configuration management

**Cross-References:** 
- See: [Crisis Investigation Methodology](#crisis-investigation-methodology)

---

### Testing Neglect Anti-Pattern {#testing-neglect}

**Problem:** Insufficient testing leading to production issues and difficult debugging

**Symptoms:**
- Manual testing as primary quality assurance method

### Silent Failure Tolerance Anti-Pattern {#silent-failure-tolerance}

**Problem:** Accepting system degradation without detection or alerting

**Symptoms:**
- Features failing without user notification or developer awareness

- Data integrity issues discovered long after occurrence
- System monitoring focusing on availability rather than functionality

**Prevention Strategy:**
- Proactive monitoring of feature functionality rather than just system availability
- User experience monitoring detecting functionality degradation
