# Institutional Memory

**Purpose:** Long-term searchable archive of proven patterns, lessons learned, and battle-tested knowledge

**Mental Model:** Deep iceberg content - you descend here when you need proven solutions, want to avoid known failures, or are facing complex problems that require institutional wisdom.

**Access Pattern:** Search-driven discovery via Grep/Ctrl+F, anchor-based navigation, referenced during crisis or complex decision-making

**Update Frequency:** Knowledge graduation from sessions via pre-compact protocol, pattern consolidation during major learnings

## Core File: KNOWLEDGE_ARCHIVE.md

**Purpose:** Structured library of patterns, anti-patterns, debugging protocols, and institutional wisdom
**Organisation:** Hierarchical navigation with anchor-based cross-references
**Size:** Can grow large (1,000+ lines) - this tier is designed for comprehensive knowledge storage

### Knowledge Categories

**Architecture Patterns:** Proven technical approaches and design decisions  
**Debugging Protocols:** Systematic approaches for crisis management and troubleshooting  
**Development Patterns:** Incremental execution, evidence-first methodologies, quality standards  
**Anti-Patterns:** Documented failures and how to avoid them  
**Crisis Management:** Recovery procedures and systematic failure handling  

## Navigation Standards

### Anchor Format
All major sections use: `{#kebab-case-format}` for reliable cross-referencing
Example: `## Evidence-First Debugging {#evidence-first-debugging}`

### Cross-Reference Patterns
- `[Pattern Name](../institutional-memory/KNOWLEDGE_ARCHIVE.md#anchor-id)`
- Descriptive link text with specific anchor targets
- Maintained link integrity during knowledge moves

### Search Optimisation
- Pattern titles include searchable keywords
- Grep/Ctrl+F friendly organisation
- Progressive disclosure from categories to specifics

## Knowledge Graduation Process

### From Sessions (Pre-Compact Protocol)
1. Review existing knowledge archive for novelty
2. Ensure structural compliance with documentation patterns
3. Add only genuinely valuable, reusable patterns
4. Follow established navigation and cross-reference standards

### Quality Standards
- **Evidence-Based:** Include concrete examples and implementation details
- **Prevention Value:** Document what problems the pattern solves
- **Battle-Tested:** Only patterns proven through actual usage
- **Domain-Specific:** Tailored to your specific context and challenges

## Maintenance Disciplines

### Critical Reality
KNOWLEDGE_ARCHIVE.md is the **operational heart** of MEMENTO. Poor stewardship turns institutional memory into institutional confusion, making the entire framework counterproductive overhead.

### Periodic Maintenance Requirements
- **Content Gardening:** Remove session-specific contamination, resolve tier boundary violations
- **Duplication Detection:** Eliminate competing sources of truth across tiers
- **Link Integrity:** Repair broken cross-references and anchor inconsistencies
- **Organisational Coherence:** Maintain logical categorisation and navigation flow
- **Protocol Validation:** Ensure patterns conform to documentation standards

### Stewardship Investment
Expect to invest **entire sessions** (potentially 200k+ tokens) on systematic maintenance as session learnings accumulate. This is not overhead - it's the core process that prevents framework decay and preserves MEMENTO's systematic advantage.

### Maintenance Triggers
- Navigation index becomes unwieldy
- Broken cross-references detected
- Session-specific details contaminating patterns
- Overlapping or contradictory guidance
- Search efficiency degradation

**Without disciplined stewardship, this tier degrades from institutional wisdom to cognitive noise, destroying MEMENTO's value proposition.**
