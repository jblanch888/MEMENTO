# BACKLOG.MD

**Purpose:** Evidence-based priority management with workflow states and user validation

---

## Priority System

### P0 (Critical - Immediate)
- System-breaking issues requiring immediate attention
- Blockers preventing all development progress

### P1 (High - This Sprint/Week)  
- High-impact features with clear user value
- Technical debt significantly affecting development velocity

### P2 (Medium - Next Sprint)
- Planned enhancements with documented user need
- Refactoring for improved maintainability

### P3 (Low - Future)
- Nice-to-have features without immediate user pressure
- Exploratory investigations for future planning

## Workflow States

### Started
Items currently being worked on with progress tracking

### Paused  
Items temporarily stopped with clear resume conditions

### Done ✅
Completed items with user validation and evidence

### Discarded ❌
Items no longer relevant with documented reasoning

## Multi-Session Plans

Complex features broken into logical units with validation gates:
- **Slice-based approach** with incremental user validation
- **Clear success criteria** for overall feature completion
- **Evidence requirements** for each validation point

*Reference this for daily priority decisions. Update workflow states as work progresses. Add evidence for all priority decisions.*
