# SYSTEM_OVERVIEW_TEMPLATE.md

**Purpose:** ML-optimised rapid context acquisition template for complex systems

**Note:** Create domain-specific versions when post-compact sessions suffer from context confusion. This pattern emerges from actual need, not upfront planning.

## System Purpose

[Single sentence describing what your system does and why it exists]

## Core Architecture

[Scannable format showing key components and data flow]

```
[Input] → [Process 1] → [Process 2] → [Output]
```

**Key Technologies:**
- **[Technology 1]:** [Purpose and role in one line]
- **[Technology 2]:** [Purpose and role in one line]
- **[Technology 3]:** [Purpose and role in one line]

## Key Operations

**[Primary Operation]:**
```bash
[command or process]
```

**[Secondary Operation]:**
```bash
[command or process]
```

**System State Check:**
- [How to verify system is operational]
- [Key indicators of health/problems]

## Critical Context

**Current State:** [Where system stands operationally]
**Active Challenges:** [Known issues or focus areas]
**Key Patterns:** See [Relevant Pattern](../institutional-memory/KNOWLEDGE_ARCHIVE.md#pattern-anchor) in institutional memory

## Real-World Example

For reference, see how this pattern was implemented in Sky-KA's ML pipeline context:
- Complex 6-stage ML processing pipeline
- Multiple technologies (LLM processing, vector search, knowledge graphs)
- Domain-specific operational procedures
- Cross-references to institutional memory patterns

This enabled post-compact Claude to immediately understand system mechanics rather than spending sessions learning basic operational reality.
