# Active Knowledge

**Purpose:** Multi-session reference material requiring frequent access (the iceberg's visible portion below working context)

**Mental Model:** You descend here from working context when you need consistent principles, current priorities, or cross-session guidance. Bigger than working context but still svelte.

**Access Pattern:** Referenced during decision-making, planning, and when working context needs principled guidance

**Update Frequency:** As architectural decisions evolve or priorities shift significantly

## Typical Contents

- **Project principles and philosophy** - Core decision-making frameworks
- **Current priorities and backlog** - What matters most right now  
- **Architecture patterns** - Consistent technical approaches
- **System context files** - Domain-specific rapid context acquisition for post-compact productivity
- **Cross-session reference material** - Information needed across multiple sessions

---

## Size Discipline

- Can be larger than working context but must stay **svelte**
- Each file should be focused and scannable
- When files grow large, extract patterns to institutional memory
- Aim for information that's accessed multiple times per week

## Context Plunge Pattern

Complex systems often require **rapid context acquisition** files for post-compact productivity. These domain-specific guides prevent post-compact sessions from "fumbling around clueless" and enable immediate productive work.

**When to Create:**
- System complexity causes post-compact confusion
- Multiple sessions spent re-learning basic operational reality
- Domain knowledge essential for effective AI collaboration

**ML-Optimised Structure:**
- **System purpose** in one clear sentence
- **Core architecture** in scannable format
- **Key operations** with concrete examples
- **Critical patterns** with cross-references to institutional memory

**Evidence:** Complex systems like ML pipelines, multi-service architectures, or domain-specific workflows benefit significantly from dedicated context files.

**This tier provides consistent reference material for principled decision-making across sessions whilst maintaining attention efficiency.**
