# Active Knowledge

**Purpose:** Multi-session reference material requiring frequent access (the iceberg's visible portion below working context)

**Mental Model:** You descend here from working context when you need consistent principles, current priorities, or cross-session guidance. Bigger than working context but still svelte.

**Access Pattern:** Referenced during decision-making, planning, and when working context needs principled guidance

**Update Frequency:** As architectural decisions evolve or priorities shift significantly

## Size Discipline

- Can be larger than working context but must stay **svelte**
- Each file should be focused and scannable
- When files grow large, extract patterns to institutional memory
- Aim for information that's accessed multiple times per week

**This tier provides consistent reference material for principled decision-making across sessions whilst maintaining attention efficiency.**
